Things learnt:

responsiveness

Input zoom: Every time you focused on the input to enter a new task the mobile device would zoom in on the field meaning other elements expanded out of view. 
Fixed by adjusting the font size of the input to 16px. Research shows this is the minimum size for mobile devices.
